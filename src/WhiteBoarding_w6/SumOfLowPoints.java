// Given a 2-dimensional array of numbers (i.e. an array of arrays), write a function
//   that returns the sum of all numbers that are *low points*. A low point is any
//   number that is smaller than its neighbors above, below, and to the left and right.
//   Example:

//  Int[][] a ={    {9, 8, 6, 5, 4},    
//         {7,`4`,7, 7,`2`},    
//         {6, 5,`0`,5, 6},
//         {3,`1`,8, 5, 8}}

//  The ‘ ‘ numbers are low points, so the function should return 4 + 2 + 0 + 1 = 7.

// Hint: The trick to this problem is making sure indices do not go out of bounds.
